brain-python-interface (a.k.a. bmi3d)
====================================
This package contains Python code to run brain-machine interface (BMIs) tasks as well as other neurophysiology experiments. This package differs from other similar packages (e.g., BCI2000--http://www.schalklab.org/research/bci2000) in that it is primarily intended for intracortical BMI experiments. 

This package has been tested extensively with the Omniplex neural recording system (Plexon, Inc.). Testing is in progress for Blackrock and TDT systems
